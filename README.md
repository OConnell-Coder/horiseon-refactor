# <Horiseon-Refactor>

## Description

Accessibility and Search Engine Optimitzation (SEO) is essential to the success of any website. This helps users find your page and provides accessibility to users with disabilities, so that you can reach a maximum potential of visibility.

The provided code produced a beautiful website, but what good is that if users cannot find or interact with it? The refactored code adds verbal components for users using screen-readers, so they are not missing out on any content. It also fixed the links, so that they lead to the correct web location. This will help users find what they're looking for and avoid frustration.

By modifying the code with semantic HTML elements, future web developers will have an easier time reading the code and implementing any bug fixes or site improvements.

## Installation

The webpage will be deployed through GitHub Pages.
Then, a simple URL will be provided for access.

## Usage

<!-- Add link to website -->
<!-- Add link to GitHub repo -->

<!-- Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
